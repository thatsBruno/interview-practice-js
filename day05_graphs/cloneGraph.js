/**
 * Problem: Clone Graph
 * LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/
 *
 * Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
 * Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
 * Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].
 * - 1 <= Node.val <= 100
 * - Node.val is unique for each node.
 * - There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
 * - The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.
