/**
 * Problem: Gas Station
 * LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/
 *
 * There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].
 * You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
 * Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - n == gas.length == cost.length
 * - 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * - 0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10^4
