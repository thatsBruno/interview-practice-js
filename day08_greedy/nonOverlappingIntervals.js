/**
 * Problem: Non-overlapping Intervals
 * LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/

 * Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5
 * - intervals[i].length == 2
 * - -5 * 10^4 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 10^4
