/**
 * Problem: Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
 * LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/
 *
 * You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.
 * Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= tokens.length <= 10^4
 * - tokens[i] is either an operator: "+", "-", "*", "/", or an integer in the range [-200, 200].
 * - It is guaranteed that the expression is always valid.
